üìä Project Report: Stock Market Forecasting and Analysis Dashboard
1. Introduction

The stock market is inherently volatile, influenced by macroeconomic events, company performance, and global market trends. Accurate forecasting and visualization tools can help investors, traders, and analysts make informed decisions.
This project aims to build an interactive dashboard that integrates real-time stock price tracking, technical indicators, and machine learning forecasting models. It is designed for ease of use and accessible deployment via Streamlit.

2. Objectives

Collect live financial data using yFinance API.

Enable interactive visualization of stock trends and technical indicators.

Apply machine learning models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) for stock price prediction.

Compare models using standard performance evaluation metrics.

Provide multi-stock comparison and portfolio analysis tools.

Ensure deployment readiness for continuous accessibility.

3. System Architecture
Data Flow

Data Source: Yahoo Finance (via yfinance)

Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, train-test splitting

Analysis & Visualization: Plotly charts, moving averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands

Forecasting Models:

ARIMA ‚Äì Statistical time series model

SARIMA ‚Äì Seasonality-adjusted ARIMA

Prophet ‚Äì Trend + Seasonality modeling by Meta

LSTM ‚Äì Deep learning recurrent network

Evaluation Metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R¬≤, Directional Accuracy

User Interface: Streamlit web application

4. Methodology
Step 1: Data Collection

Used yfinance.download() to fetch historical stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

Supported multi-stock selection and date range filtering.

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

Line charts of closing prices.

50-day & 200-day moving averages.

RSI & Bollinger Bands for trend insights.

Step 3: Forecasting Models

ARIMA: Captures autocorrelation in prices.

SARIMA: Adds seasonality adjustments.

Prophet: Decomposes time series into trend, seasonality, and holidays.

LSTM: Captures non-linear dependencies with past stock prices.

Step 4: Model Evaluation

Used metrics:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

R¬≤ Score (Goodness of Fit)

Directional Accuracy (%)

Step 5: Dashboard Implementation

Single Stock Analysis: Price charts, indicators, forecasts, metrics.

Multi-Stock Comparison: Side-by-side performance visualization.

Portfolio Analysis: Cumulative returns, correlation heatmaps.

5. Results
Visualizations

Interactive Plotly charts for stock price movements.

Forecast plots with historical + predicted ranges.

Metrics displayed via Streamlit metric cards.

Correlation heatmap for portfolio diversification analysis.

Forecasting Accuracy

Prophet & LSTM generally performed better on longer time horizons.

ARIMA/SARIMA worked well for short-term forecasts.

Directional accuracy ranged between 55‚Äì70%, depending on stock volatility.
